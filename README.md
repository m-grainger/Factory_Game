# Factory_Game
My first project in Unity- a Box moving game where you grab boxes from a conveyor belt (or as we liked to think of them- cakes), and try to make them the correct type before hitting the end of the production line!

This game started as a 4 person project, and eventually ended up with just two of us finishing up the idea.  Included in this file are all of the scripts that were involved with getting the mechanics of this game working.
